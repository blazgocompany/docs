---

Model scripts allow you to create sophisticated conversation flows with AI models. These scripts run in a secure sandbox environment with access to specific utility functions.

## Available Functions

### query()

Make calls to AI models and get responses.

```python Basic Script
# This is the most basic Model Script.
response = query("gpt-4o", conversation)
```

Parameters:
`model_name` (string): Name of the model to use (e.g., "gpt-4", "gemini-pro")
`prompt` (list): Conversation history in the proper format

<Tip>
  The `conversation` variable is already availible for you to use.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you do not set the variable `response` to the query result, you will have errors.
</Warning>

### add()

Add a new message to the conversation.

```python
conversation = add("user", "What's the weather like?", conversation)
```

Parameters:

`role` (string): Message role ("user", "assistant", "system")
`content` (string): Message content
`prompt` (list): Current conversation history

### attach()

Append or prepend content to the last message.

```python
conversation = attach("Also include wind speed.", conversation)
conversation = attach("Weather request: ", conversation, "beginning")
```

Parameters:

`content` (string): Text to attach
`prompt` (list): Current conversation history
`location?` (string, optional): "beginning" or "end" (defaults to "end")

## Available Models

The following models are available with their respective costs:

#### GPT Models

gpt-3.5-turbo
gpt-4
gpt-4-turbo
gpt-4o
gpt-4o-mini

#### Gemini Models

gemini-1.0-pro
gemini-1.5-pro-latest
gemini-1.5-flash-latest
gemini-pro

<Note>
  When using the Decentralized Plan, some models may not be availible all of the time, so we have backup models. This means that you may not get responses from the same model you requested
</Note>

## Example Model Script:

```python
# Explaining Bot Model Script:


# Add initial question
conversation = attach("user", "Give a short explaination of: ", conversation, "beginning")
initial_response = query("gpt-4o", conversation)

# Follow up with clarification
conversation = add("user", "Make a more detailed explaination now.", conversation)
detailed_response = query("gpt-4o", conversation)

# Add final response
response = {
    "initial_explanation": first_response,
    "detailed_explanation": detailed_response
}
```



## Pricing

The default pricing for all models is 5 credits (dedicated), and free (decentralized)
There are some exceptions however:

| Model Name            | Dedicated Cost | Decentralized Cost |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| gpt-3.5-turbo         | 8              | 3                  |
| gpt-4                 | 8              | 3                  |
