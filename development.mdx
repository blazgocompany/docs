## Overview

The **Model Details Page** allows you to view detailed information about a specific model, edit its properties, and test the model in a playground environment.

## Using the Model Details Page

**Accessing Model Details**: Click on a model from the Dashboard to view its details.

<Card title="The Model Script" icon="code">
  The model script allows you to create custom paths for your model. For a quick start, querying a model looks like this:

  ```python Model.ai8
      response = query("gpt-4o-mini", prompt)
  ```

  <Note>Make sure you always set the variable `response`, otherwise, we won't be able to extract the response from your script</Note>
  <Tip>The prompt variable is automatically inside your code.</Tip>
  You can also make more complex paths for your model:

  ```python SafeAnswer.ai8
      securityCheck = query("gpt-4o-mini", prompt.add("Is this a security related question:\n", "start", "last").add("Answer in 'Yes' or 'No' only"))
      if(securityCheck.lower() == 'yes'):
        
  ```
